Fit: large bin radius results in discontinuities in bright areas?
Fit: 2-component fits can be inaccurate (see Log scale for confirmation)

2D: pixel probe in lifetime mode
  * show details on curve fit result for that pixel

2D: implement spectral projection view
2D: implement emission spectraview
3D: change data fit and residuals to check boxes for surface/lines
