Fit: still something wrong with chi^2 error computation -- fix it
  * chi^2 error is inexplicably low on some horribly inaccurate curves
  * large bin radius results in discontinuities in bright areas?
  * 2-component fits can be inaccurate (see Log scale for confirmation)

3D: move view toggles into menus to free up real estate for numerical reporting
3D: change data, fit, and residuals to separate check boxes for surface & lines
  * allows viewing data as both a surface and as lines simultaneously

2D: pixel probe in lifetime mode
  * show details on curve fit result for that pixel
  * report information beneath 3D plot where view toggles used to be

2D: implement spectral projection view
2D: implement emission spectraview
