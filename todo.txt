Fit: still something wrong with chi^2 error computation -- fix it
  * chi^2 error is inexplicably low on some horribly inaccurate curves
  * large bin radius results in discontinuities in bright areas?
  * 2-component fits can be inaccurate (see Log scale for confirmation)

2D: pixel probe in lifetime mode
  * show details on curve fit result for that pixel
  * report information beneath 3D plot where view toggles used to be

3D: fix bug in FWHMs when pixel probing
3D: fix bug in yellow lines when toggling individual channels

2D: implement spectral projection view
2D: implement emission spectraview
