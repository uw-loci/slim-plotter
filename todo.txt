Both: fix color mapping widgets (range autodetection)
Both: set firstindex and lastindex cutoffs

Fit: get rid of hacky crap once setting firstindex/lastindex
Fit: large bin radius results in discontinuities in bright areas?

2D: add options for number of iterations, fps? and bin radius
2D: convert results back to picoseconds
2D: pixel probe in lifetime mode
  * show details on curve fit result for that pixel
  * show binned curve + fit in decay view

2D: implement spectral projection view
2D: implement emission spectraview
3D: change data fit and residuals to check boxes for surface/lines
2D: eliminate flickering for intensity view mode
