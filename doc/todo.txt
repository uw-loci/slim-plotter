Fit: still something wrong -- fix it
  * large bin radius results in strange blocks,
    and discontinuities in bright areas

3D: fix bug in FWHMs when pixel probing
3D: fix bug in yellow lines when toggling individual channels

2D: implement spectral projection view
2D: implement emission spectraview

View all channels simultaneously vs one at a time (2D plot)
Improve results in the circled region first

The larger the chi2, the dimmer the pixel could be? I.e., ability to plot
different parameters in 2D lifetime window to three different color components

Use forms for GUI

Numbers for RENDERER:
  - Phase, percent complete
  - Iteration #
  - Worst RCSE
  - Total RCSE

Numbers for active CURVE FITTER:
  - a1 raw, a1 %
  - t1 raw, t1 ps
  - a2 raw, a2 %
  - t2 raw, t2 ps
  - c
  - chi^2 raw, chi^2 reduced

Improve export button: also export curve statistics for current curve,
including formulas -- makes it easy to duplicate plot in Excel
